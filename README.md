# HBridge-Arduino-Shield
During my senior year of highschool I entered the Science Olympiad Electric Vehicle competition. I wanted to make everything for this competition from scratch. My plan was to use as little "pre-made" parts as possible. To control the motors on my car, I made my own arduino H bridge shield. This allowed me to control the direction of each DC motor independently. The H-Bridge IC is the L239D. However, I did not end up using this board in the final competition, but I still learned a lot from making it. I designed the board in eagle and printed it in my highschools makerspace.

WHAT I LEARNED:
- EAGLE circuit design
- How to use the L239D H Bridge IC
- Soldering
- Circuit board printing
- Learned more about the intricacies of DC motors
